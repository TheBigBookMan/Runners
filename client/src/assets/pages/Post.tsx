//* this is the page to view the post uploaded from the site, this will just be a simple API call to whatever place and have that specific activity details uploaded, better to have it called from the API rather than stored from the database as it will grow too much

//* Surely each app will have an ID stored with each activity and so can store that ID into the database here and then use that as the API call

const Post = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Post</h1>
    </div>
