# Runners

## Introduction
This is an application where users can create a group with friends, upload their running data from different applications (Strava, Nike Run Club) and then compare the data with one another. This solves the problems of people being on different applications.

## Technologies
This app uses Javascript/Typesript, ReactJS, Prisma, GraphQL, TailwindCSS, MongoDB and multiple ReactJS packages.
